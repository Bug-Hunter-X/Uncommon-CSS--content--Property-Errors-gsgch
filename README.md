# Uncommon CSS `content` Property Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors and unexpected behaviors that can occur when using the CSS `content` property with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.  The `content` property, while seemingly straightforward, can lead to subtle issues when combined with other CSS properties or used with complex values.

The `bug.css` file shows examples of problematic code, and the `bugSolution.css` demonstrates the corrected or improved approaches.

## Issues Covered

* **Invalid string values:** Using an incorrect or incomplete string value with the `content` property.
* **Interactions with other properties:** Unexpected behavior or errors when `content` is combined with properties such as `counter-reset`, `counter-increment`, or properties affecting the positioning or layout of generated content.
* **Compatibility issues:** potential differences in rendering or behavior across different browsers or CSS engines.
