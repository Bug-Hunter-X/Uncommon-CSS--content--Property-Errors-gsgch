The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if the `content` property is used incorrectly or with incompatible values, it can lead to unexpected rendering or layout issues. For example, using a complex or invalid string can cause errors, and issues can arise from using the `content` property alongside other properties that modify or interact with generated content, potentially in unexpected ways.  Also, if it interacts with some other properties like `counter-reset` or `counter-increment`, that could lead to unforeseen problems.
